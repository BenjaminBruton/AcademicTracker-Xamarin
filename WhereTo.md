# AcademicTracker-Xamarin
Android app built with Xamarin forms. Used to record and track academic progress. Terms, courses for terms, instructor data and assessments associate with courses. Notifications for course and assessment start/end dates, note sharing functionality.

Unfortunately, I did not have a repo set up when I started this project and at the end the file was too large to upload.
I uploaded to DropBox and the files will be available there upon request.

You may email me at bbruton@wgu.edu for access.
